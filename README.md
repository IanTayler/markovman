## Notes
Markovman is currently under development! Browse the source code if you're interested.

If you plan on contributing, please note commit messages should be of the form `<path/from/src/to/main-file-affected>: Write a message`.

Like so:

```
markovman.c: Improve UTF-8 support
```
or
```
lib/statemach.c: Change RNG method to improve performance
```
The exception is when the file is in the main directory. In that case, no such prefix is necessary (or desired).
```
Update README.md
```
```
Add FreeBSD build support to Makefile
```
